    "In today's world 2 of the most widely scrutinized sectors of our society are the movies and tech firms. While they are widely different fields and usually have no relation to each other, one area where they shread a common thread is gender diversity or more accurately the lack of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie industry have been criticized for gender issues over the years. But the outroar is ususally limited to the most high profile movies and productions. But acting as a profession is not limited to just movies and just Hollywood. International movies, TV shows, short movies are also an important part of this industry. This project is an attempt to look just at the numbers and see how diverse are movies in terms of the gender of people playing roles on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are then compared against diversity numbers released by 6 top tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google) for the year of 2017 to see how these two fields stack up. This comparison throws up some insights that are quite surprising and eye opening."

    "When it comes to movies and gender, the Bechdel test is perhaps the most commonly known and accepted way of determining how much independent representation and interaction females have. This project, which looks only at the numbers of credited actors/actresses, is not that comprehensive and the results are not a conclusive indication of the full picture. But augmented with other inputs (like the bechdel test), my hope is it will help build a clearer picture. The core question being asked here is -- How gender diverse are movies solely in terms of actors on the screen? \n",
    "\n",
    "Under pressure for their lack of gender diversity, major companies in the tech sector have been releasing their workforce diversity information over the last few years showing how they have been improving their diversity over the years. But hiring a lot of females interns for the summer or junior employees is given the same weight as having a management structure full of males. I try to look into how these two fields' statisctics would compared if movies are afforded the same leeway as these tech firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, I am not proposing that is a very comprehensive analysis since first of all, it is restricted only to actors and actresses and not any other crew member. So the results of this analysis must be taken with a pinch of salt, while being open to interpretation."

   "source": [
    "This project looks at gender diversity in movies over the past 118 years (1910-2018). The data used is provided by IMDB, and contains all the data on their website with respect to movies, release date, actors and actresses in the movie etc in the form on zipped tsv files. Due to the size being > 100MB, I have made a subset of the data available in the data folder of this repo as tsv files. These files can be used to reproduce the analyis done in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most ideal case would have been to get gender related information about all the crew members who work on a movie, but IMDB does not store gender information about any person. The only way to identify actors vs. actresses is to depend on the lsiting which classifies them either as 'actor' or 'actress'. This was a potential roadblock both due to lack of non-binary gender representation and also lack of info for people working behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But delving more in IMDB's policies, I realized that IMDB allows people to create their profile and add themselves to the credits of movies they acted in (subject to verification). And the most interesting thing was that it identifies them by their preferred gender. While not optimal, it seemed more ethical to work with this data because the gender information I would be getting about a person was not what IMDB chooses but what the person choose him/herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming to the diversity data in tech companies, I manually read the diversity reports publicly published by the companies for the year of 2017 and stored these values in an array for the purposes of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall number of records in the source data considered were 1.6M movies, 8.9M actors and actresses, and nearly 31M records of the crew details. A lot of this was filtered out to keep details of only actors and actresses, mainly because there is no gender information available for other crew members like directors, producers, cinematographers etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three major tables considered -- movie_title_details, actor_details and movie_crew_details. Python libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib were used for data analysis and visualization. This section shows how to read the data, show the structures and columns of the tables, analyze the data and visualize the results."

In 1964, the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed which prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. These and many other laws passed in different countries, along with the feminist movement gathering momentum could have had an impact on the movie indutry resulting in more actresses on the screen in the post 1960s period."

While this is a little negated by the equal weight that companies give to a summer intern and a corporate head, it is true that in some cases simply more actresses on a screen would not be indicative of a more gender diverse environment. It would be complicated but combining movies scripts and the character names given in the IMDB dataset, we can estimate the number of lines spoken by a character and estimate that as a percentage of the whole script.
