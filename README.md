## Abstract

Nowadays, the industry and media claim that gender diversity is improving and more and more women are playing major roles than ever. At the same time, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. have started to enforce gender equality requirements trying to make the workplace more diverse. They have also been releasing yearly diversity reports to show the increase in diversity.

The aim of this project is to analyze IMDB's actor and movie datasets for gender statistics in terms of number of actors and actresses potrayed on the screen every year, visualize the statistics obtained for the time period over which data is available and then compare the results to the diversity percentages released by tech companies Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft. Off the bat, the feeling is that both were male dominated industries for several decades and might still be. But has there been a change in this percentage over the years?


## Data

The primary sources of data used in this project are from IMDB, which are hosted [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). The data is updated periodically and can be downloaded directly from this link.

A desciption of the datasets and the various fields are given [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). 

Each dataset is contained in a gzipped, tab-separated-values (TSV) formatted file in the UTF-8 character set. 

The first line in each file contains headers that describe what is in each column. A ‘\\N’ is used to denote that a particular field is missing for that title/name --- ([reference](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)).
